# DPN Tears of SRE Microservices - Swagstore

The Swagstore app consists of a 12-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

It is a fictitious e-commerce swag store, don't expect to receive swags :grinning:

## Quick Start

To run the application locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd tsre-microservices

# Build and start all services
docker-compose build 
docker-compose up -d
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the application:

### Required Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DD_API_KEY` | Your Datadog API key for monitoring and observability |
| `DD_APP_KEY` | Your Datadog Application key (required for loggenerator service) |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `CTHULHU_URL` | Optional URL for Cthulhu integration in payment service | Not set |
| `DD_ENV` | Environment name for Datadog | `tsreenv` |
| `DD_SITE` | Datadog site URL | `datadoghq.com` |

### Setting Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in several ways:

1. **Using a `.env` file** (recommended for local development):
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file in the project root
   echo "DD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   echo "DD_APP_KEY=your_app_key_here" >> .env
   ```

2. **Using environment variable exports**:
   ```bash
   export DD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   export DD_APP_KEY=your_app_key_here
   ```

3. **Inline with docker-compose**:
   ```bash
   DD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here DD_APP_KEY=your_app_key_here docker-compose up -d
   ```

**Note:** The Datadog API and Application keys are required for proper monitoring and observability features. You can obtain these keys from your [Datadog account settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys).

## Features
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

**At Datadog we use the app to experiment with APM, Tracing Libraries, Admission Controller and auto injection. It is perfect as a playground if you want to play and instrument the microservices written in multiple languages.**

## How to Use

### Datadog Agent
The Datadog Cluster Agent configuration is located in `ctf/datadog-values.yaml`.

> **Note:** If you are running the Datadog Cluster Agent locally (e.g., via Docker) or on Google Cloud, ensure that certain settings, such as `datadog.networkMonitoring.enabled`, are disabled.

### Running the Application
All service configurations are available in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

If using the [TSRE Terraform Script](https://github.com/DataDog/trse-terraform), the application will be started automatically using `start.sh`.

If you are running TSRE Microservices locally or not using the [TSRE Terraform Script](https://github.com/DataDog/trse-terraform), run the following commands from the `tsre-microservices` repository to start the services:

```bash
docker-compose build 
docker-compose up -d
```

If you want to run the pre-built images, run the following commands:
```bash 
docker-compose -f docker-compose-pre-built.yml build 
docker-compose -f docker-compose-pre-built.yml up -d
```

## Rebuilding the Services

To rebuild services after making code changes in the `src` directory:

1. Ensure that your IAM user in the DPN Network IAM has read/write access to the Public ECR Registry (e.g., AWS user).

2. Authenticate Docker with your IAM user on your local machine (replace `<Username>` and `<Password>`):
```bash
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username <Username> --password-stdin <Password>
```

3. Rebuild the images (replace `<tag-name>` as needed). Run these commands from the `tsre-microservices` directory:
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/adservice:<tag-name> --push src/adservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/cartservice:<tag-name> --push src/cartservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/checkoutservice:<tag-name> --push src/checkoutservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/currencyservice:<tag-name> --push src/currencyservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/emailservice:<tag-name> --push src/emailservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/loadgenerator:<tag-name> --push src/loadgenerator/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/paymentdbservice:<tag-name> --push src/paymentdbservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/productcatalogservice:<tag-name> --push src/productcatalogservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/recommendationservice:<tag-name> --push src/recommendationservice/
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t public.ecr.aws/v6x4t1k2/shippingservice:<tag-name> --push src/shippingservice/
```

4. Update the `spec.template.spec.containers.image` in the respective `tsre-microservices/ctf/<servicename>.yaml` file with the appropriate tag.

## About

**Swagstore** is a heavily modified version of the original [Google Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), specifically adapted for Datadog's experimentation with APM, tracing libraries, and microservices instrumentation. The items featured in the Swagstore are actually Datadog swag items.
