# Notebooks related Webhooks
[Notebooks](https://docs.datadoghq.com/notebooks/) can be helpful for tracking work and taking markdown notes alongside metrics charts. You may want to create a Notebook related to an Alert notification.

## Getting started
First complete the general Webhook Getting started.

## Considerations
The `create_notebook` example is a template which provides examples of different types of cell data that can be displayed. It may be helpful to prototype in a Notebook and export to JSON to easily copy/paste the proper cell format.
